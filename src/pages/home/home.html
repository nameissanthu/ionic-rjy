          The annals of history indicate the existence of the city to a time before 1022 AD.The city derived its name from its first ruler the Chalukya king, Raja Raja Narendra. Remnants of 11th century palaces and forts dot the landscape. However, new archaeological evidence suggests that the town may have existed much before the Chalukyas. After the Chalukyas, came the Kakatiya Dynasty in 1323 AD, the Reddy and Gajapathi dynasties took over after which followed the Vijayanagar kingdom, which gave way to the Nizams who in turn were taken over by the French and eventually the British. Rajamahendravaram was renamed Rajahmundry during the rule of the British. The district of Rajamundry was created in 1823 and reorganised in 1859 and bifurcated into the Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajahmundry was the district headquarters. Godavari district was again split into East and West Godavari districts in 1925. It served as a hot house for several movements during India's freedom struggle and was the base for many leaders. The Vande Mataram Movement went on full swing from here in the year 1905 against the partition of Bengal. Present day Rajahmundry is an industrial and trading hub and many multinational companies such as ITC Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline, GVK Industries, to name a few have set up shop here. Rajahmundry is all set to climb the ladders of 21st century advancement.
